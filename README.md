# 50-DaysOfRust Challenge

A structured 50-day Rust learning and project challenge starting Hacktober 1st. This plan balances learning core concepts and building practical Rust projects.

## Week 1: Rust Basics & Syntax

**Day 1-5:**
- Install Rust and set up the development environment.
- Learn basic syntax: variables, data types, functions, conditionals, loops.
- **Project:** Create a simple CLI calculator to practice basic operations and user input.

**Day 6-7:**
- Dive into ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes.
- **Project:** Extend your calculator to handle complex operations and introduce error handling.

## Week 2: Structs, Enums, and Error Handling

**Day 8-9:**
- Learn about structs and enums.
- **Project:** Build a small inventory management system using structs and enums.

**Day 10-11:**
- Understand pattern matching and control flow.
- **Project:** Add pattern matching to the inventory system, allowing for item categorization.

**Day 12-14:**
- Deep dive into Rust's error handling with `Result` and `Option`.
- **Project:** Add error handling to the inventory, making it more robust.

## Week 3: Collections and Iterators

**Day 15-17:**
- Learn about vectors, hash maps, and strings.
- **Project:** Build a contact book app, allowing for the addition, removal, and search of contacts.

**Day 18-19:**
- Master iterators and closures.
- **Project:** Add sorting and filtering options to the contact book using iterators.

**Day 20-21:**
- Study traits and generics in Rust.
- **Project:** Refactor the contact book to make it more generic and reusable.

## Week 4: Async Programming and Concurrency

**Day 22-25:**
- Learn async programming with `tokio`.
- **Project:** Build an asynchronous web scraper that fetches and processes data from multiple websites concurrently.

**Day 26-28:**
- Study concurrency using threads.
- **Project:** Modify the web scraper to handle multiple scraping tasks concurrently.

## Week 5: Working with Files, Crates, and Modules

**Day 29-31:**
- Learn file I/O in Rust and how to use crates.
- **Project:** Build a log parser that reads logs from a file and generates a report.

**Day 32-34:**
- Learn about Rust modules and crate structures.
- **Project:** Refactor the log parser to be modular and scalable.

## Week 6: Web Development with Actix or Warp

**Day 35-38:**
- Study basic web development in Rust using `actix-web` or `warp`.
- **Project:** Create a simple REST API for a TODO app.

**Day 39-41:**
- Add database integration with `SQLx` or `Diesel`.
- **Project:** Extend the TODO app to store tasks in a Postgres or SQLite database.

## Week 7: Advanced Topics (FFI, Unsafe, Macros)

**Day 42-44:**
- Learn about Foreign Function Interface (FFI) and using C libraries in Rust.
- **Project:** Build a small Rust application that uses a C library for some functionality.

**Day 45-47:**
- Dive into unsafe Rust.
- **Project:** Build a memory-efficient data structure using unsafe code for performance optimization.

**Day 48-50:**
- Study Rust macros and how to create your own.
- **Project:** Create a custom derive macro to automatically generate code for common tasks in one of your previous projects.
